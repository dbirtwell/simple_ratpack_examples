# Ratpack Simple Authentication with Encryption

A simple Groovy/Ratpack application demonstrating simple authentication including encryption.

This is based off of:

http://jameswilliams.be/blog/entry/216

but has been ported to the latest Rapack branch:

http://www.ratpack-framework.org/

https://github.com/ratpack

I moved the "authentication" check into the main ratpack groovy script.

NOTE:

Doing encryption/decryption in javascript alone is NOT SECURE at the time this code was written.
If you want a secure connection and SSL (HTTPS) is recommended.

This code is put out there as a learning exercise and is NOT guranteed to be the best way to do things and should not be used for production code.
You have been warned!

NOTE:

This is based upon several resources I discovered on the internet.
I will add resource links links when I update the project.

For now see:
