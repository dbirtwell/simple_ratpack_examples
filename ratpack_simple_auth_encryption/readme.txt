This is based off of:

but has been ported to the latest Rapack branch:

http://www.ratpack-framework.org/

https://github.com/ratpack

I moved the "authentication" check into the main ratpack groovy script.

NOTE:

Doing encryption/decryption in javascript alone is NOT SECURE at the time this code was written.
If you want a secure connection and SSL (HTTPS) is recommended.

This code is put out there as a learning exercise and is NOT guranteed to be the best way to do things and should not be used for production code.
You have been warned!
