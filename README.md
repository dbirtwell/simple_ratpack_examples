# Simple Ratpack Samples

A bunch of simple Groovy/Ratpack applications/scripts demonstrating some basic concepts.

Many of these are my revisions of existing example, modified for my own personal edification.

No claims of originality, usefulness or even workability is claimed.

Maybe, just maybe, someone can use this stuff other than me.

NOTE:

This is based upon several resources I discovered on the internet.
I will add resource links links when I update the projects.

For now see:
