# Ratpack Simple Session handling demo

A simple Groovy/Ratpack application demonstrating how to put things into the session and retreive them as well.

Right now I can't think of where I got the starting poing, maybe one of the Ratpack examples, or maybe the source code.

NOTE:

This is based upon several resources I discovered on the internet.
I will add resource links links when I update the project.

For now see:

for details on the Ratpack Framework
